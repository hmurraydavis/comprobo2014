##Warmup Project##

#Overview and Objectives#
This was written as a homework assignment for [Computational Robotics](https://sites.google.com/site/comprobofall14/home) at Olin College. The objective of the assignment was to gain familarity working wih [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), implemennt a finite state controler, and develop behaviors for a robot. This was achieved by iniating the nodes and subscribes for ROS, then progressing into a finite state controler which governed which behavior the robot opperated in at a given time.
